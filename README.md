This repository presents the process and results of a Differential Power Analysis (DPA) attack on an Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm, executed using power trace data from AES-ECB mode encryptions. The primary objective of this study was to extract a 128-bit AES secret key by analyzing side-channel power traces generated during encryption operations. Using Pearsonâ€™s correlation method, we targeted the leakage points in the power traces corresponding to intermediate states of the AES encryption process. Key guess plots and maximum likelihood estimations were analyzed to identify the most probable key bytes. Through the application of DPA on the first byte and subsequently the entire key, the secret key was successfully recovered. Further evaluation involved comparing the efficiency of the DPA attack with a theoretical brute-force cryptanalysis, highlighting the strength of side-channel attacks. Additionally, we explored the limitations of DPA on a different hardware implementation and discussed potential adjustments to improve attack success under varying conditions. The results demonstrate the vulnerability of AES to power-based side-channel attacks, emphasizing the need for secure cryptographic implementations.
